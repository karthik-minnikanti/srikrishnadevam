# Lord Krishna Images - Setup Instructions

## Current Status
The website currently uses placeholder images. You need to add actual Lord Krishna images.

## Where to Get Lord Krishna Images

1. **Wikimedia Commons** (Free, high-quality):
   - Search: "Krishna" on https://commons.wikimedia.org
   - Filter by "Free to use"
   - Download and save to `assets/img/`

2. **Your Own Photos**:
   - Take photos of Lord Krishna statues/artwork at your temple
   - Save them to `assets/img/`

3. **Free Image Sites**:
   - Pixabay.com (search "Krishna")
   - Unsplash.com (limited Krishna images)

## Required Images

You need these images:

1. **Hero background**: `assets/img/hero.jpg` (1600x900 recommended)
2. **Seva cards** (3 images): 
   - `assets/img/seva1.jpg` (Archana)
   - `assets/img/seva2.jpg` (Abhishekam)
   - `assets/img/seva3.jpg` (Annadanam)
3. **Gallery images** (8 images minimum):
   - `assets/img/gallery1.jpg` through `assets/img/gallery8.jpg`

## After Adding Images

The website will automatically use images from `assets/img/` once you place them there.
The HTML files are already set up to use these paths.
